# Java_Chess
This is a chess game in Java 9 that I wrote.


## Game Features
- The game is pretty feature complete.  It features all the standard moves of the given pieces.  
- If you get your pawn to the other end you can swap it out for any other piece.

## Missing Features
- Check/Check-mate detection is not implemeneted.  You need to directly capture the King to win.
- Castle.  No rook/king switchero.


## How to run
The instructions are pretty simple.  It should run on any system.
```
cd src
javac Main.java
java Main
```
